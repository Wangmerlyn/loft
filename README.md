# LOFT: A 1 Million+ Token Long-Context Benchmark

This repository houses the resources for LOFT, the Long Context Frontiers benchmark, introduced in the research paper [Can Long-Context Language Models Subsume Retrieval, SQL, and More?]().
LOFT consists of 6 long-context task categories spanning retrieval, multi-hop compositional reasoning, and more, totaling 30+ datasets and 4 modalities.

**Initial Release**
We provide access to a subset of the LOFT data (NQ and QUEST) to provide a hands-on experience and a feel for the types of tasks involved.
We also provide an example prompt in `PROMPT_EXAMPLE.txt` showing an example of how prompting can be done for the text retrieval task.

**Future Releases**
We're actively working on expanding this repository.
Upcoming releases will include:

* Code for Dataset Regeneration: Enabling a user to recreate the full range of LOFT datasets.
* Task-Specific Evaluation Code: Providing code to measure LCLMs' performance on each LOFT task.

**Updates**

* [6/18/24]: Initial release with links to a portion of LOFT data subsets.
